## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://alystrom5062.github.io/Milestone-1-Web-Game/>.

## Project Description

A demo of an adventure game in which you solve puzzles. I wanted to make something similar to what I make using the RPG Maker engine.

## Credits:

- All visual assets are done by me. Every visual asset aside from the directions image are my own recycled assets from various RPG Maker projects.

## Game Logic

Player Interactions and Possible Decisions:

  The player character can move with the arrow keys within the bounds of the square map and collision.
  The player can interact with different objects such as levers, buttons, and NPCs on the map.
  The player is meant to solve two puzzle based on color patterns and order of events interacted with. These are simple puzzles used to demonstrate my JS ability.

Victory and Loss

    The player can win by completing the two puzzles and unlocking the fourth NPC on the map.
    The player can mess up the puzzles, but they reset so another attempt can be made. Otherwise there is no consequence to failing the game.

```

### MVP Criteria

- The character can move with the arrow keys in accordance to which key is pressed.
- Character is subjected to the boundries of the map including map wall and objects such as NPCs.
- Character can press Enter to pull a lever on the wall or press a button on the floor and have the sprite change.
- Buttons and Levers have a specific order which they must be interacted with. If the pattern is not correct they will reset and player must start over.
- The NPCs either change color or speak to you when interacted with. 
- There is a new NPC which spawns after beating the two puzzles indicator of when you beat both puzzles and win.

```

### Post-MVP Plans

- More detailed End Cutscene.
- You are able to speak with NPCs.
- Text that pops up when you complete or fail a puzzle.
- SFX.
